After several days of phoning friends and attempting to self trouble shoot with the help of AI, I got nowhere. I called AJ Long Electric and they sent out Sai who showed up within 2-hours of my call (I did not request emergency service). He diagnosed the problem on no time and came up with a quick fix which I nor ChatGPT would have figured out. He was very friendly and also helped to educate me on what was happening which I appreciated after my many failed attempts at fixing this issue myself. I would definitely recommend A.J. Long Electric and I'd recommend asking for Sai.",

Yesterday he fixed two receptacles outside, placing grey boxes on each receptable so the GFCI would not trip when it rained or snowed. Most important though was he discovered the front light on the lower level was improperly installed, which could have caused a fire and burned down our home. He worked two hours on replacing the wiring and re-installing the light and now the light works properly and it looks great. The price AJ Long Electric charged was very fair.

        comment: "Great experience. I called but didn't leave a message. I instead scheduled for a week out on their web app. Someone then called me and indicate I could get an appointment next day, which is what I wanted in the first place. Got the email estimate and it was about what I expected. I asked how soon the work could be done, and the electrician checked with his manager. The reshuffled his load and he was able to start immediately. Work took about four hours between the cold garage and the basement. He took a brief break for lunch., but then back at it. Very hard working. Skilled electrician who efficiently executed the installation. Couldn't have asked for a better experience.",

        comment: "I am very pleased with the service provided by Jason from AJ Long Electric. I had a power outage in the master bedroom and bath and could not figure where the problem was. Jason arrived on the near side of the arrival window and go right to work in diagnosing the problem. He then explained everything to me in terms I could understand and let me see what he was doing while he resolved the issue. All this was done in a timely manner on relatively short notice. I would use this service again and would recommend it to friends/family.",
